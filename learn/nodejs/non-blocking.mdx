  In Node, non-blocking primarily refers to <strong>I/O operations</strong>, and
  JavaScript that exhibits poor performance due to being CPU intensive rather
  than waiting on a non-JavaScript operation, such as I/O, isn't typically
  referred to as blocking.

Async actions do not block the event loop.

Synchronous code:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs')
const data = fs.readFileSync('/file.txt') // everything is blocked until file is read
```

<LearnSectionContent>Asynchronous code:</LearnSectionContent>

```javascript
const fs = require('fs')

fs.readFile('/file.txt', (error, data) => {
  if (error) throw error

  console.log(data)
})
```
