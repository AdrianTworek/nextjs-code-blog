Much of the Node.js core API is built around an idiomatic asynchronous event-driven architecture in which certain kinds of objects (called "emitters") emit named events that cause Function objects ("listeners") to be called.

Example:

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events')

class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}

const myEmitter = new MyEmitter()
myEmitter.on('event', () => {
  console.log('an event occurred!')
})

myEmitter.emit('event')
```
